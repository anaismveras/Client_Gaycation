## Elevator Pitch
Humans who identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community, especially if they are “visually queer”, don’t always feel safe going on vacation everywhere. There are still many cities and countries around the world where LGBTQIA+ people are not accepted and they could be discriminated against. Gaycation shows vacation spots for LGBTQIA+ people or couples to vacation somewhere that they don’t have to be in fear to hold their partner’s hand in public.

## User's Stories
Anyone who is in the LGBTQIA+ community that likes to go on vacation
